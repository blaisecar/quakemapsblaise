This is my concept for a Quake Deathmatch map I would like to create!

My idea for this level is separated into two levels of verticality. Both ssides start at opposite diagonal planes of the map, while a heart pickup rests in the center,
surrounded by walls to grant cover to the fighters. Along with the cover, there are also side hallways, (possibly some underground?) that allow for more close quarters combat, as well as a way to sneak up on enemies. The outdoor space and the side halls lead to a stairwell that goes to some armor pickups and floor two, which takes you on a skybridge above lava, with inital blocking walls to not give players above a too large advantage. These walls open up once the player reaches the middle of the map on the second level, with full open air, exposing them to shoot the enemies, as well as to be shot. There are a few walkways to fight on up there as well, but with no given cover.
The skywalk can be used to drop into the center and claim the health pickup, at the risk of being shot or falling into the lava. The skywalk can also be used to potentially ambush enemies!
