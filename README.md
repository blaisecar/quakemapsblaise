This is my concept for a Quake Deathmatch map I would like to create!

My idea for this level is separated into two levels of verticality. Both ssides start at opposite diagonal planes of the map, while a heart pickup rests in the center,
surrounded by walls to grant cover to the fighters. Along with the cover, there are also side hallways, (possibly some underground?) that allow for more close quarters combat, as well as a way to sneak up on enemies. The outdoor space and the side halls lead to a stairwell that goes to some armor pickups and floor two, which takes you on a skybridge above lava, with inital blocking walls to not give players above a too large advantage. These walls open up once the player reaches the middle of the map on the second level, with full open air, exposing them to shoot the enemies, as well as to be shot. There are a few walkways to fight on up there as well, but with no given cover.
The skywalk can be used to drop into the center and claim the health pickup, at the risk of being shot or falling into the lava. The skywalk can also be used to potentially ambush enemies!


GREYBOX 


My map was vaguely based upon the sketch that I did last week.

However, since I did not like this design too much, I heavily improvised as I went along, sticking with the same relative base concept.
I ended up with something I like far more, with far more hallways, platformings, layers, and overall interesting design, instead of a bland
big room.

There are still some issues regarding flow that I want to address, along with some weird leaks and other issues, possibly some new routes and staircases,
and of course cool lighting and effects. I am excited to see how my map continues, I have been very happy with it so far.

METRICS

I personally struggled with this section. The measurment system was a bit confusing to me so I played a lot of the design by ear. May be something I have to change in the future.
