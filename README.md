This is my concept for a Quake Deathmatch map I would like to create!

My idea for this level is separated into two levels of verticality. Both ssides start at opposite diagonal planes of the map, while a heart pickup rests in the center,
surrounded by walls to grant cover to the fighters. Along with the cover, there are also side hallways, (possibly some underground?) that allow for more close quarters combat, as well as a way to sneak up on enemies. The outdoor space and the side halls lead to a stairwell that goes to some armor pickups and floor two, which takes you on a skybridge above lava, with inital blocking walls to not give players above a too large advantage. These walls open up once the player reaches the middle of the map on the second level, with full open air, exposing them to shoot the enemies, as well as to be shot. There are a few walkways to fight on up there as well, but with no given cover.
The skywalk can be used to drop into the center and claim the health pickup, at the risk of being shot or falling into the lava. The skywalk can also be used to potentially ambush enemies!


GREYBOX 


My map was vaguely based upon the sketch that I did last week.

However, since I did not like this design too much, I heavily improvised as I went along, sticking with the same relative base concept.
I ended up with something I like far more, with far more hallways, platformings, layers, and overall interesting design, instead of a bland
big room.

There are still some issues regarding flow that I want to address, along with some weird leaks and other issues, possibly some new routes and staircases,
and of course cool lighting and effects. I am excited to see how my map continues, I have been very happy with it so far.

PLAYER FEEDBACK

Here I will document some of the feedback that I got from players. 
Things I should fix are as following
- Some stairs are broken, need fixing
- Too many open rooms
- Map needs better flow, more places to filter into
- Better gun and ammo placements
- More halls, more cover

  GREYBOX ITERATION

  In response to feedback, I decided to numerous things. Firstly, I made everything more easy to traverse. Wonky staircases and leaks have been fixed, and cool trains have been added as well!

  Cool train that takes you up to the upper level, easier than the long staircase.

  More rooms were also added, as well as many connections between existing rooms. These connected rooms here make a segway between 3 parts of the map, and also allow for another alternate way to get to the
  top of the map, as to avoid players pooling at the bottom.

More improvements were also made to quality of life stuff.

The parkour now feels better!

As for any improvements, I think more unique rooms like this would be cool, and also continuing to fix flow and wonky geometry will make everything more polished!

Other things such as weirdly placed lava were removed, drops that hurt you now have health pickups where you land, more cover has been added to many rooms, and the general flow and options that you have to traverse to at any given time have been largely increased. I also added some fancy railings and pillars that should hopefully spice up the geometry and visuals.
There is still much to do, but I hope my improvements will make the map way more fun to play!
