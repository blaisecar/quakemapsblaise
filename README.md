This is my concept for a Quake Deathmatch map I would like to create!

My idea for this level is separated into two levels of verticality. Both ssides start at opposite diagonal planes of the map, while a heart pickup rests in the center,
surrounded by walls to grant cover to the fighters. Along with the cover, there are also side hallways, (possibly some underground?) that allow for more close quarters combat, as well as a way to sneak up on enemies. The outdoor space and the side halls lead to a stairwell that goes to some armor pickups and floor two, which takes you on a skybridge above lava, with inital blocking walls to not give players above a too large advantage. These walls open up once the player reaches the middle of the map on the second level, with full open air, exposing them to shoot the enemies, as well as to be shot. There are a few walkways to fight on up there as well, but with no given cover.
The skywalk can be used to drop into the center and claim the health pickup, at the risk of being shot or falling into the lava. The skywalk can also be used to potentially ambush enemies!


GREYBOX 


My map was vaguely based upon the sketch that I did last week.

However, since I did not like this design too much, I heavily improvised as I went along, sticking with the same relative base concept.
I ended up with something I like far more, with far more hallways, platformings, layers, and overall interesting design, instead of a bland
big room.

There are still some issues regarding flow that I want to address, along with some weird leaks and other issues, possibly some new routes and staircases,
and of course cool lighting and effects. I am excited to see how my map continues, I have been very happy with it so far.

PLAYER FEEDBACK

Here I will document some of the feedback that I got from players. 
Things I should fix are as following
- Some stairs are broken, need fixing
- Too many open rooms
- Map needs better flow, more places to filter into
- Better gun and ammo placements
- More halls, more cover

  GREYBOX ITERATION

  In response to feedback, I decided to numerous things. Firstly, I made everything more easy to traverse. Wonky staircases and leaks have been fixed, and cool trains have been added as well!

  Cool train that takes you up to the upper level, easier than the long staircase.

  More rooms were also added, as well as many connections between existing rooms. These connected rooms here make a segway between 3 parts of the map, and also allow for another alternate way to get to the
  top of the map, as to avoid players pooling at the bottom.

More improvements were also made to quality of life stuff.

The parkour now feels better!

As for any improvements, I think more unique rooms like this would be cool, and also continuing to fix flow and wonky geometry will make everything more polished!

Other things such as weirdly placed lava were removed, drops that hurt you now have health pickups where you land, more cover has been added to many rooms, and the general flow and options that you have to traverse to at any given time have been largely increased. I also added some fancy railings and pillars that should hopefully spice up the geometry and visuals.
There is still much to do, but I hope my improvements will make the map way more fun to play!

PLAYTEST 2

After these changes listed, more playtesting was done. 
Here are some stats from the first playtest to the second, where a survey was done for each based on numerous things.

"Overall Enjoyment of Map"

"Pickups are positioned to draw players into contested areas and encourage the use of the whole map."

Every single stat shows an upward trend, which leads me to believe that the work I have been iterating on the map has been successful in making it more interesting and fun. I hope that in this week's iteration, the data continues to trend upward. I didn't change much layout for the next coming playtest, but I think the new colors and lights will make areas easier to find and make everything more distinguishable.

Texturing

Immersion and Theme
For the theme of the level, I was vaugely going for a sort of "Evil Church" thing, with stone architecture and mosiac stained glass pillars, combined with red lights and lava.

Usage of Lava and Red Light
![image](https://github.com/blaisecar/quakemapsblaise/assets/153130544/1308be27-911a-44c5-b7c4-ade9955475ac)

Both of these go to convey the previously mentioned Evil Church type theme, with pretty church-like glass, combined with lava and red lighting, the red lighting emenating from the glass pillars and lava at numerous points in the level. I tried to not put red lighting everywhere as to make it feel more standout in the rooms where it does appear, opting to mostly use torches to add to atmosphere plus some occasional extra light blocks for places the torches were not reaching. I also use the lava lighting to make very stark and dramatic lighting, as some rooms are very dark from certain sides, which I think looks cool and adds to the look. (I made sure not to make those rooms TOO dark, though.)

Guidance and Orientation

For my level, the textures should play a huge part in how the player is guided. I wanted the top floor and the bottom floor to be very distinct from eachother, as the top floor contains lots of greys and blues, and more regular lighting, a huge sky texture, windows, as well as stained glass. These let the player know that they are at the higher point of the level. On the other hand, the bottom floor has much more red lighting, red floors and walls, and more lava, which is to signify that they are lower down. I also added spotlights, to certain items and doorways to make them easy to see, and I used one of the fundamental rules of map design, that floor textures should only change at elevation changes, to signify elevation change and different sections of the map.

Here, the blue bricks are used when the elevation goes higher, as to help the player differentiate the low ground from high ground, to increase ease of readability and navigation.

PLAYTEST 3

I did a final test with the class to get some final helpful thoughts.

Stats of improvement in enjoyment of the map trended upwards here, which is good.

However, most of the stats have actually trended down, purely because I got one player who really did not like my map at all, which was frusturating as my map is defintely better than it was before in all other opinions of those who played it previously.
The student in question had reasonable criticisms, largely about the map being far too big, which I agree on. However, this would be very hard to actually change at this stage in development, as I would essentially have to redo the map from scratch. However, in level designs in the future, I will keep these thoughts in mind in order to improve.
