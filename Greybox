My map was vaguely based upon the sketch that I did last week.

However, since I did not like this design too much, I heavily improvised as I went along, sticking with the same relative base concept.
I ended up with something I like far more, with far more hallways, platformings, layers, and overall interesting design, instead of a bland
big room.

There are still some issues regarding flow that I want to address, along with some weird leaks and other issues, possibly some new routes and staircases,
and of course cool lighting and effects. I am excited to see how my map continues, I have been very happy with it so far.
